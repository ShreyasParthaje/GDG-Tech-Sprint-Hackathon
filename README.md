# HOSTEL MANAGER 

Hostel manager is a collection of two apps, one for the students and one for admin to solve the problem of food wastage in hostels and any institution that has a mess. 
The admin app is responsible for creating and viewing demands of meals.
The students can vote for meals from the client side app.
